## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Flexbox and Grid are really powerful tools to make the layout of a project. Originally, I used the position property when setting the media queries, because I was having a hard time with Grid. After a good night sleep a decided to give it a try again and I'm really happy how it turned out.

### Continued development

I'm not entirely convinced with the sizes of some of the cards on the media queries, I'm going to check out some designs to see how I can improve it.
